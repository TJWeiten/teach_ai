PREREQUISITES
-----------------------------
PHP
MySQL
A server that can execute 'java' and 'javac' commands

INSTALLATION
-----------------------------
To install the AI development platform, upload these files to a web server that fulfills the requirements set forth above.
Go to /core/database/connect.php and edit in your MySQL database credentials. Then import the provided install.sql file to the database you're using.

NOTES
-----------------------------
The system requires 4 working bots in order to test user's code, and will most likely crash spectacularly if you try to run it with less than 4 users having their Bot_Working tag set to '1'. 
It is recommended you install 4 "dumbots" by creating 4 unique users and saving/compiling the following code:

	public double rateFirstCard(int card) {  
		return 100 * Math.random();  
	}
			
	public double rateCard(int card) {
		return 100 * Math.random();   
	}
		
	public double rateCardPass(int card) { 
		return 100 * Math.random();
	}
	
After that, when the testing system is run it should always be able to find at least four working bots.

TO-DO
-----------------------------
There are a number of things that are uncompleted within the system, but I'll add these later.
